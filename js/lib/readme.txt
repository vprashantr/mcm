Underscore provides 80-odd functions that support both the usual 
functional suspects: map, select, invoke — as well as more 
specialized helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality testing, and so on. 
It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so modern browsers will use the native implementations 
of forEach, map, reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.
